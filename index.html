<br>Upon receiving the verse, the Prophet [s] stopped on that place (the
pond of Khumm) which was extremely hot. Then he sent for all people who
have been ahead in the way, to come back and waited until all pilgrims
who fell behind, arrived and gathered. He ordered Salman [r] to use rocks
and camel toolings to make a pulpit (<i>minbar</i>) so he could make his
announcement. It was around noon time in the first of the Fall, and due
to the extreme heat in that valley, people were wrapping their robes around
their feet and legs, and were sitting around the pulpit, on the hot rocks.
<p>On this day the Messenger of Allah [s] spent approximately five hours
in this place; three hours of which he was on the pulpit. He recited nearly
one hundred verses from The Glorious Quran, and for seventy three times
reminded and warned people of their deeds and future. Then he gave them
a long speech.
<p>The following is a part of his speech which has been widely narrated
by the Sunni traditionists:

<b><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial">Revelation of Qur'anic
Verse 70:1-3</font></b>
<br>Some Sunni commentators further report that the first three verses
of the chapter of al-Ma'arij (70:1-3) were revealed when a dispute arose
after the Prophet [s] reached Madinah. It is recorded that:
<p>On the day of Ghadir the Messenger of Allah summoned the people toward
'Ali and said: "Ali is the <b><i><font color="#990000">mawla</font></i></b>
of whom I am <b><i><font color="#990000">mawla</font></i></b>." The news
spread quickly all over urban and rural areas. When Harith Ibn Nu'man al-Fahri
(or Nadhr Ibn Harith according to another tradition) came to know of it,
he rode his camel and came to Madinah and went to the Messenger of Allah
[s] and said to him: "You commanded us to testify that there is no deity
but Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah. We obeyed you. You ordered
us to perform the prayers five times a day and we obeyed. You ordered us
to observe fasts during the month of Ramadhan and we obeyed. Then you commanded
us to offer pilgrimage to Makkah and we obeyed. But you are not satisfied
with all this and you raised your cousin by your hand and imposed him upon
us as our master by saying `Ali is the <b><i><font color="#990000">mawla</font></i></b>
of whom I am <b><i><font color="#990000">mawla</font></i></b>.' Is this
imposition from Allah or from you?"&nbsp;
<p>The Prophet [s] said : "By Allah who is the only deity! This is from
Allah, the Mighty and the Glorious."
<p>On hearing this Harith turned back and proceeded towards his she-camel
saying: "O Allah! If what Muhammad said is correct then fling on us a stone
from the sky and subject us to severe pain and torture." He had not reached
his she-camel when Allah, who is above all defects, flung at him a stone
which struck him on his head, penetrated his body and passed out through
his lower body and left him dead. It was on this occasion that Allah, the
exalted, caused to descend the following verses:
<blockquote>"A questioner questioned about the punishment to fall. For
the disbelievers there is nothing to avert it, from Allah the Lord of the
Ascent." (70:1-3)</blockquote>
